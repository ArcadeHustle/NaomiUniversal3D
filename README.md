## Fair Use Declaration

17 U.S. Code § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

All visual representations of Sega Naomi Universal Cabinet, Net City, dedicated driver, shooter, special variant cabinets, or any reasonable likeness there of are soley for the intent of non-profit preservation, or restoration efforts. 

The intent it to complement historic Sega arcade machines that are now considered rare. This work is not intented to replace any official Sega in-game assets, or physical arcade machines, or parts. 
Much like the defendants in Kienitz v Sconnie, we have "removed so much of the original that, as with the Cheshire Cat, only the smile remains”, in this case ~what is left, besides a hint of Naomi’s smile, is the outline of her facade, which can’t be copyrighted.”

These models will aid in the scholalry research, and education of individuals that seek to understand the look and feel of late 90's and early 2000 era Sega arcade machines, without having physical access to them.

## Usage

The original intent of these models was for use with Facebook Oculus Quest 2 Platform, inside of the Unity development environment via the "VR Template".

You can demo them in the "Build Your First VR" tutorial if you are unfamiliar with Unity
https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-tutorial/?locale=en_US

They are presented here in a portable format that will remain interoperable between both Unity, and Blender.

## STL export for 3D Print

You can make use of Blender to generate STL files from the .fbx files in order to make them compatible with common 3D printing software tools.

Prints are currently taking an estimated 2+ days.
